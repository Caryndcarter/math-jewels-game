# Magic Math Jewels Game
A one-page math game app I built with JavaScript and Bootstrap during my time in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. We were given a minimal description of what our game should do and expected to figure it out.  

Play it here: 

## Play Magic Math Jewels!

* The game begins by showing you a random number.
* You have 4 magic jewels that each have a secret numeric value.
* When you click on a magic jewel, you add its value to your total score. 
* When your total score equals the random number, an alert will tell you you've won!
* When your total score exceeds the random number, an alert will tell you you've lost. 
* When you win or lose, the game will re-start.  
* The number of times you win and lose are tallied at the bottom of the screen. 
* To clear your wins and losses, refresh the page.
